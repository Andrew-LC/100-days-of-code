# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating the basic boilerplate for the next js app and created the page route.

**Thoughts:** I'm finding the new app router and server components a bit harder to use than the pages layout ðŸ˜…, I'm not sure how I am going to approach this project and a few things in it, but I feel like I might be onto something.
